# BYU-Room-Finder-Python-Backend

This is the Python backend for the BYU Room Finder project. This project is a web application that allows users to find available rooms on the BYU campus. The backend is responsible for handling requests from the frontend and querying the database for room availability.

This project is built using Python and Flask. The database is a postgresql database that contains information about the rooms on campus as pulled from the byu room information website.
In it's current state it serves as the backend for https://github.com/BYU-CS-Discord/CSBot
It was [originally written by Phineas Jensen](https://github.com/phinjensen/byu-tools) but it has been rewritten in it's current state by me. The project doesn't get a ton of use so it is in a maintenance state, I will fix bugs as they come up but I don't really plan on adding any new features.
